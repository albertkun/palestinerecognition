Andorra,"In January 2011, Andorra co-sponsored a draft resolution guaranteeing the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.[195] In September, it argued for a proposed resolution to give the State of Palestine observer status in the United Nations.[196]",No,
Armenia,"On 20 June 2011, Fatah representative Nabil Shaath met with Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandyan to enlist the support of Armenia in the upcoming resolution.[197] Afterwards, Shaath announced that he had been informed by a number of countries that they would recognize Palestine in the following weeks, and that he expected Armenia to be the first of these.[198] However, the Armenian government did not release any statement regarding the meeting. The situation in Palestine is seen as analogous by the Armenian government to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, and that any recognition of a Palestinian state by Armenia would set a precedent for the right to self-determination in that region.[199] On similar situations, President Serzh Sargsyan previously stated, ""Having the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Armenia can not recognize another entity in the same situation as long as it has not recognized the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic"".[200]",No,CSTO; Armenia–Palestine relations
Austria,"Austria conferred full diplomatic status on the PLO representation in Vienna on 13 December 1978, under then-chancellor Bruno Kreisky.[205] In June 2011, Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger said that Austria ""had not yet made up its mind whether to support a UN recognition of a Palestinian state"", adding that he preferred to wait for a joint EU approach to the issue. ""We will decide at the last moment because it might still give [the two parties] the opportunity to bring the Middle East peace process back on track.""[206] Spindelegger also suggested that the EU draft its own version of the resolution.[207]",,

Belgium,"On the issue of Palestinian statehood, Belgium supports a joint position within the European Union.[209] In 2011, Prime Minister Yves Leterme called for a European consensus, while the Senate urged the government to recognize a Palestinian state with pre-1967 borders.[210] The Chamber of Representatives adopted a similar position on 5 February 2015. The left-wing opposition called for unconditional recognition of Palestine.[211][212] Despite these declarations, Belgium hasn't recognized the State of Palestine yet. In May 2024, Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib stated that recognition was not up for discussion, but it wouldn't be granted at the time,[213] while Prime Minister Alexander De Croo stressed that recognition was ""symbolic"" and wouldn't have ""any impact in the field"".[214]",Yes,"EU, NATO"
Cameroon,"Cameroon officially supports a two-state solution.[215] Although a member of the OIC, President Paul Biya has developed strong ties with Israel since the mid-1980s.[216] This perceived friendship has soured the country's traditionally close ties with Arab states, many of whom have withdrawn longstanding economic development assistance and pressed Biya to support Palestinian interests.[217] Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu asked Biya to oppose the United Nations resolution that would admit Palestine as a member state.[218]",Yes[215],"AU, OIC[41]"
Croatia,"Croatia formalized relations with the PLO on 31 March 2011. Former Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor stated in 2011 that her government supported the co-existence of Israel and Palestine as two independent states,[221] however Croatia abstained during voting on upgrading Palestine to non-member observer state status in the United Nations and on admission of Palestine to UNESCO. Former Croatian Foreign Minister Vesna Pusić stated on 24 October 2014 that ""Croatia will most likely recognize Palestine soon"".[222] The Croatian government tends to favour Israel over Palestine as a commitment to the United States, to whom Croatia is aligned, and the central quarters of the European Union of which Croatia has been a member since 2013. Croatia believes that if it were to recognize Palestine, this would frustrate its position with the EU and ties to the US, and also because the situation in the Middle East is complicated it feels there is no guarantee that there would be peace and further existence of the Jewish state if Israel eventually decides to withdraw from the occupied territories.[223]",Yes,"EU, NATO"
Denmark,"Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen met Abbas on 9 March 2011 to persuade him to return to negotiating with Israel. Espersen also extended Danish support to Palestinian national development.[224] During the campaign for the 2011 elections, the largest opposition party argued that Denmark should recognize the State of Palestine. Foreign Minister Lene Espersen, however, warned that such a unilateral decision could have ""more negative than beneficial"" consequences, and stressed the need to co-ordinate policy with the EU.[225] In December 2014, a bill that called on Denmark to recognize Palestine as a state was rejected in the Danish parliament.[226]",Yes,"EU, NATO; Denmark–Palestine relations"
Eritrea,"Eritrea is one of only two African countries that does not recognise Palestine, the other being Cameroon.[41][227] In October 2010, President Isaias Afewerki stated, ""Israel needs a government, we must respect this. The Palestinians also need to have a dignified life, but it can not be the West Bank or Gaza. A two-state solution will not work. It's just to fool people. Israelis and Palestinians living in the same nation will never happen for many reasons. One option that may work is a Transjordan. Israel may be left in peace and the Palestinian and Jordanian peoples are brought together and can create their own nation"".[228] In his address to the UN General Assembly in 2011, Isaias stated that ""Eritrea reaffirms its long-standing support to the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and an independent, sovereign state. It also upholds the right of Israel to live in peace and security within internationally recognized boundaries.""[229] On 29 November 2012, Eritrea voted in favour of a resolution to make Palestine non-member observer state at the UN.",Yes[230],AU
Estonia,"During a meeting with Riyad al-Malki in June 2010, Minister Urmas Paet said the country approved an agreement between the two countries and ""self-determination for Palestine"".[231] Officials stated that the government would not adopt a position regarding the United Nations bid until the final wording of the resolution was published.[232]",Yes[233],"EU, NATO"

France,"According to President Nicolas Sarkozy, ""France supports the solution of two nation states living side-by-side in peace and security, within safe and recognized borders.""[237] In May 2011, Sarkozy said that if peace talks with Israel had not resumed by September, he would recognize the State of Palestine as part of its bid at the United Nations.[238] This echoed statements made in March by Nabil Shaath, who claimed to have received a promise from France that it would recognize in September a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.[239] According to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, however, Sarkozy had said that France's support would require the Palestinians to recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people.[237] This was confirmed in July, when Foreign Minister Alain Juppé stated that any solution to the conflict would require the recognition of ""the nation-state of Israel for the Jewish people, and the nation-state of Palestine for the Palestinian people.""[240] This broke with the European Union's traditional position, which adamantly opposes any mention of Israel as a Jewish state.[241] Sarkozy later turned around on this policy, reportedly saying that the idea of a Jewish state was ""silly"".[242] In August, Sarkozy stressed the importance of a united EU position on the September initiative, and proposed a compromise where the State of Palestine would be given observer status instead of full membership. The proposal, which was to prevent a split among members of the EU, included a promise from Paris and other members that they would vote for the resolution.[243] In October 2014, France's foreign minister said France would recognize a Palestinian state even if peace talks with Israel fails.[244] On 2 December 2014 the French National Assembly approved a non-binding motion calling on the government to recognise Palestine.[245]",Yes,"EU, G7, G20, NATO, UNSC (permanent)"
Germany,"In April 2011, Chancellor Angela Merkel labelled the Palestinian bid for recognition a ""unilateral step"",[246] and stated unequivocally that Germany will not recognize a Palestinian state without its prior acceptance by Israel. ""Unilateral recognitions therefore definitely do not contribute to achieving this aim ... This is our stance now and it will be our stance in September. There needs to be mutual recognition, otherwise it is not a two-state solution"".[247] She also reaffirmed her government's commitment to see an agreement reached as soon as possible. ""We want a two-state solution. We want to recognize a Palestinian state. Let us ensure that negotiations begin. It is urgent"".[248]",,

Greece,"President Karolos Papoulias has stated that Greece ultimately supports the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.[249] Under previous governments, Greece garnered a reputation as a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause.[250] Within the wider Arab–Israeli conflict, Andreas Papandreou maintained a stronger stand against Israel than any other government in the European Community. Diplomatic relations were founded with the PLO in 1981, while relations with Israel were maintained only at the consular level until Greece's formal recognition of Israel in 1990 under Mitsotakis.[251] Since the formation of current foreign policy under George Papandreou, Greece has seen a rapid improvement in relations with Israel,[252] leading the media to mark the conclusion of Greece's pro-Palestinian era.[253] However, in December 2015, Greece's parliament voted in favour of a motion requesting that the government recognize Palestine.[254]",Yes,"EU, NATO; Greece–Palestine relations"

Italy,"In May 2011, at an event in Rome celebrating Israel's independence, then Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi pledged his country's support to Israel.[255] In June, he reiterated Italy's position against unilateral actions on either side of the conflict, stressing that ""peace can only be reached with a common initiative through negotiations"".[256] This position was shared by parliamentarians, who drafted a letter to the United Nations stating that ""a premature, unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood would [...] undermine rather than resolve the Israeli–Palestinian peace process"".[257] Nevertheless, at the same time, Italy upgraded the diplomatic status of the Palestinian delegation in Rome to a mission, similarly to what other EU countries were doing, giving the head of the delegation ambassadorial status.[258] Moreover, on 31 October 2011, Italy did not oppose Palestine's UNESCO membership bid[259] and, on 29 November 2012, Italy voted in favour of UN Resolution 67/19, giving Palestine a non-member observer state status at the United Nations.[260] Italy's opposition to unilateral actions was reiterated on 21 December 2017, when it voted in favour of a UN draft resolution calling on all countries to comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the status of Jerusalem,[261] following the decision by the U.S. to move its embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to the city.[262]",Yes,"EU, G7, G20, NATO; Italy–Palestine relations"
Japan,"Japan supports a two-state solution to the conflict,[263] and supports the establishment of a Palestinian state.[264] In October 2007, a Japanese Justice Ministry official said ""Given that the Palestinian Authority has improved itself to almost a full-fledged state and issues its own passports, we have decided to accept the Palestinian nationality"".[265] The Japanese government declared that it would not recognize any act that would jeopardize a Palestianian state with the pre-1967 borders nor the annexation of East Jerusalem by Israel.[266][267] Japan voted favorably for the United Nations General Assembly resolution to accord Palestine Non-member Observer State status in the United Nations in November 2012, and since then, refers to the country as ""Palestine"".[268]",Yes,"G7, G20"

Luxembourg,"In an interview with Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn in March 2011, The Jerusalem Post stated that Luxembourg was considered among the ""least friendly"" countries to Israel in the EU.[276][277] In response to divisions within the EU regarding the Palestinians' September bid for UN membership, Asselborn reportedly urged the PNA to accept an upgrade in its observer status and not ask for membership. He insisted, ""We cannot let the Palestinians leave New York at the end of the month with nothing"",[278] He referred to the positions of four members in particular that stood as an obstacle to the achievement of a common position,[269] but that he ""cannot agree to say no"" to the Palestinian endeavour.[279] He noted that securing the support of all EU nations would have been a great moral advantage for Palestine.[278] In December 2019, Asselborn wrote to Josep Borrell, the head of EU foreign policy, urging a debate on recognising Palestinian statehood.[280]",Yes,"EU, NATO; Luxembourg–Palestine relations"
Marshall Islands,"The Marshall Islands has, like the US, long been a close voting ally of Israel at the United Nations. In December 2017, the Marshall Islands was one of just nine countries (including the US and Israel) to vote against a motion adopted by the UN General Assembly condemning the United States' recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital city.[281] Additionally, it was one of only five countries (the others being Israel, the US, Micronesia and Nauru) to oppose a UN draft resolution in November 2020 on the creation of a Palestinian state.[282]",No,PIF
Federated States of Micronesia,"The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is a consistent supporter of Israel, especially in international resolutions,[285] though this is due in part to its association with the United States.[272] Former FSM President Manny Mori said that the relationship goes back to 1986, when Israel made ""[an] early decision to support Micronesia's membership in the UN"".[286] During the summit of the Pacific Islands Forum in September 2011, the leader of the Micronesian delegation reportedly stated his country's solidarity with the Palestinian people's suffering and support for their right to self-determination. Regarding the PNA's endeavour to gain admission to the United Nations, however, the official stated that the agreements signed with the U.S. prevented the FSM from voting according to its government's wishes in cases where they conflicted with those of the U.S.[269] In reference to Israel's continued development assistance to Micronesians, another diplomat noted, ""We need Israeli expertise, so I don't see a change in our policy anytime soon.""[285]",No,PIF

""We've got a reputation for being fair minded and even handed on this matter and all we can do is wait to see the words.[293] He also told Riyad al-Malki that he had refused to give any pledges Israel to oppose to vote.[269] Since 2017, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has reiterated her support for a two-state solution and opposition to settler expansions.[295][296]",Yes[145],PIF
